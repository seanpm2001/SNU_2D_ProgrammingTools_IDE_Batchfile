REM I have decided to have the first and main project language file for this project (SNU / 2D / ProgrammingTools / IDE / Batchfile) to be Batchfile, as it is the main language used for this IDE, and may need to be supplemented with another language, as I am not sure how effective bootstrapping batchfile is.
